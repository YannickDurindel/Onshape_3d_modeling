An engine I designed myself.
There is still an issue : the crankshaft is touching the frame, so if you print it, you cant make the engine turn, such a shame...
NB : also have to increase the distance btwn the piston and the valve, to make it slide more easily.
And by the way, this is not a thermal engine, which is why the piston has a so weird shape, I have an idea how to make i twork differently, but that I won't post it...
Indeed, it would be not cool for a thermal engine to be printed in platic, or even made in aluminium :)
